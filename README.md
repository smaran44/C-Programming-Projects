# 🚀 C Programming Projects

Welcome to my **C Programming Projects Repository!** 🎯  
This repository contains **10 exciting projects** that showcase my skills in **game development, system utilities, file handling, and algorithmic problem-solving using C.**  

## 📂 **Projects Overview**
Each project is designed to enhance understanding of **core C concepts** like loops, functions, pointers, file handling, and more.  

### 🔥 **Projects Included:**
1. 🎮 **[Number Guessing Game]** – A fun interactive game using random number generation.
2. 🖩 **[Simple Calculator]** – A basic calculator handling arithmetic operations and error validation.
3. ⏰ **[Real-Time Digital Clock]** – Displays time dynamically in **12-hour & 24-hour formats.**
4. 📊 **[Dynamic Progress Bar]** – A visually appealing **progress bar with real-time updates.**
5. 🔒 **[User Management System]** – Features **user registration, login & password masking.**
6. 🏦 **[Bank Management System]** – A **file-based banking system** with secure authentication.
7. 🧩 **[Sudoku Solver & Interactive Sudoku]** – Solve Sudoku automatically or play interactively.
8. ❌⭕ **[Tic-Tac-Toe Game]** – Play against **AI or a friend with score tracking & difficulty modes.**
9. 🐍 **[Snake Game]** – Classic **snake game** with **wrap-around & classic modes.**
10. 💰 **[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]** – Console-based **quiz game with lifelines & timers!**

## 🛠 **Getting Started**
### 🔹 **Prerequisites**
- A **C compiler** (e.g., GCC, MinGW, or Turbo C++)
- A **terminal or command prompt** to run the programs

### 🔹 **How to Compile & Run**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/smaran44/C-Programming-Projects.git
   cd C-Programming-Projects

2. Navigate to a project directory:
   cd Number_Guessing_Game

3. Compile the program using GCC:
   gcc guessing_game.c -o game.exe

4. Run the executable:
   ./game.exe
